An intelligent chatbot that communicates with users and provides smart responses in real-time.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Responses**: The bot answers user questions in real time based on input.
2. **Conversation Tracking**: It can maintain the context of the conversation.
3. **User Input Validation**: Ensures only valid inputs are processed.
4. **Simple API**: Easy-to-use endpoint for sending messages and receiving responses.

## Usage

The project consists of both frontend and backend components:

- Frontend: The `public` folder contains `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` for the user interface.
- Backend: `server.js` handles the server-side logic and API endpoints.

To interact with the chatbot, use the interface provided in the `index.html` file.
